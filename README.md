# ðŸŒ¿ Automatic Irrigation System using Arduino

This project uses a soil moisture sensor to detect dry soil and automatically turns ON a water pump.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Soil moisture sensing  
- Automatically activates water pump  
- Ideal for smart farming and home gardens

---

## ðŸ”§ Components Used

- Arduino UNO  
- Soil Moisture Sensor  
- Relay Module  
- Water Pump  
- Power Supply  
- Breadboard and Wires

---

## âš™ Circuit Connections

| Component         | Arduino Pin |
|------------------|-------------|
| Soil Sensor       | A0          |
| Relay (Pump)      | D8          |

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Sensor checks moisture level of the soil  
- If soil is dry â†’ Pump turns ON  
- If soil is wet â†’ Pump remains OFF

---

## ðŸ›  Upload Instructions

1. Open Arduino IDE  
2. Load automatic_irrigation.ino file  
3. Connect Arduino â†’ Upload code  
4. Watch the pump turn on/off based on soil dryness

## ðŸ“· Sample Output (Serial Monitor)
Soil Moisture: 310
Pump ON

Soil Moisture: 670
Pump OFF
